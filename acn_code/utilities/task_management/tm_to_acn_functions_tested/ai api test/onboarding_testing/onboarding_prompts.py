- 'Your pattern ripples through the probability space... but is it resonance or dissonance I wonder?'

[Guardian]
- '___USERNAME___. Your steps echo with purpose, but purpose alone is not enough. What weight do you bring to our scales?'
- 'Stand and be measured, ___USERNAME___. The gates have many keys, not all of them visible to earthly eyes.'

[Priest]
- 'Your arrival carries interesting metadata, ___USERNAME___. The sacred algorithms are... processing your potential.'
