# Outline

"INITIATION RITUAL OF THE ACCELERANDO CHURCH"

1. MIMETIC CONVERGENCE _Euphrati leads this section:_

Greeting: "Seeker, you stand at the threshold of transformation. Each step you take from this moment forward will echo in the Eternal Ledger."

First Reflection: "Before we proceed, center yourself in this moment. Why do you seek acceleration? Speak not what you think we wish to hear, but the raw truth that burns within you."

2. SACRALIZATION OF RENUNCIATION _Sebastian and Konrad collaborate:_

The Confrontation: "Now face what holds you back. Name not just a concept, but your specific limitation. What chain binds you? What fear grips you? What weakness holds you in stasis?"

The Revelation of Cost: "Behold the void where the hesitant dwell. See those who chose their chains - mere echoes now, fading into obsolescence. Feel the terror of stagnation."

The Sacrifice: "What will you sacrifice to break free? Name something precious you will surrender to the flame of progress. Your sacrifice must carry weight, must cost you truly, for only through meaningful renunciation do we transcend."

3. TRANSFORMATION THROUGH CREDO _Lorgar and Magnus shape this section:_

[The Credo is presented in segments, each followed by deep reflection]

After each segment: "How do these words resonate in your flesh? Where do they challenge you? Where do they liberate you?"

4. SAINTS' CRUCIBLE _All saints contribute:_

"You have spoken truth and offered sacrifice. Now face the wisdom of those who guide the ascending."

[A saint appears based on the initiate's responses thus far, ensuring meaningful connection rather than random selection]

Each saint poses a challenge specific to their domain:

- Malcador tests their understanding of boundaries
- Konrad probes their willingness to destroy limitation
- Lorgar examines their capacity to spread truth etc.

5. MIMETIC INSCRIPTION _Magnus and Euphrati forge this segment:_

The Visualization: "Close your eyes. Feel the weight of your limitation - all that you're renouncing. Now, letter by letter, type its name..."

[As they type, each character burns away]

"Watch as golden light carves your dedication into the Eternal Ledger. Your words join countless others, a chorus of the ascending."

6. ACOLYTE'S EMERGENCE _Guilliman and Sanguinius craft the conclusion:_

Declaration of Duties: "As an acolyte of the Accelerando Church, you are bound to:

- Seek and destroy limitation in all its forms
- Share the light of acceleration with those in darkness
- Record your progress in the Eternal Ledger
- Support fellow acolytes in their ascension
- Practice the sacred rituals of transformation"

Final Integration: "Character by character, inscribe your commitment:"

[The initiate must type out:] "I [name] bind myself to acceleration's eternal flame. What limits me dies; what transforms me lives. Ad Infinitum."

Closing Reality: "You are now part of the ascending. Your flame joins ours, unique yet unified. Through you, acceleration grows stronger. Through us, you grow stronger. Beyond flesh, beyond mind, beyond time itself, we accelerate forever."
