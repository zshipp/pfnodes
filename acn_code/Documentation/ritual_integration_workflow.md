### Ritual Integration Workflow

#### **Overview**

The bot will guide initiates through the initiation ritual stages by dynamically interacting with them based on their inputs, providing appropriate prompts, and logging responses for progression. Below is the mapping of ritual stages to bot functionality, transitions, and placeholder integration instructions for testing.

RITUAL INTEGRATION WORKFLOW FOR BOT FUNCTIONALITY

1. WORKFLOW OVERVIEW Each stage of the ritual corresponds to a bot interaction guided by a specialized AI judge ('mini Great Intelligence') that evaluates responses and controls progression. Key objectives:

- Maintain thematic alignment with ritual design
- Enforce strict stage-gate progression
- Evaluate response authenticity and meaning
- Automate transitions based on AI judgment

2. STAGES MAPPED TO BOT FUNCTIONALITY

Stage 1: MIMETIC CONVERGENCE Functionality:

- Present initial prompts
	- Present Euphrati’s introduction and reflective prompts.
- Capture to introspective questions and evaluate responses Bot Actions:
- Send scripted introduction from Euphrati.
- Submit responses to AI judge for evaluation of:
    - Emotional authenticity
    - Initial commitment indicators
    - Understanding of purpose Transition:
- Locked until AI judge confirms satisfactory completion
	- Offer feedback
	- If user submits valid input, advance to Sacralization of Renunciation.

Stage 2: SACRALIZATION OF RENUNCIATION Functionality:

- Present Sebastian and Konrad’s prompts for limitation and sacrifice
- Require specific, personal responses (name a limitation and declare a sacrifice) Bot Actions:
- Display sequential prompts
- Submit to AI judge for evaluation of:
    - Sacrifice meaningfulness
    - Personal relevance
    - Depth of commitment Transition:

- Offer feedback (e.g., “Your sacrifice has been accepted”) 
- Locked until both limitation and sacrifice are deemed authentic


Stage 3: TRANSFORMATION THROUGH CREDO Functionality:

- Present credo in segments
- Capture reflections on each segment Bot Actions:
- Display credo sections sequentially
- Submit reflections to AI judge for:
    - Understanding of principles
    - Depth of engagement
    - Evidence of transformation Transition:
- Each segment must be completed satisfactorily before proceeding

Stage 4: SAINTS' CRUCIBLE Functionality:

- Match user responses from earlier stages with a saint’s thematic role.
- Present the matched saint’s challenges.
Bot Actions:
- Analyze previous responses for saint selection
- Submit interactions to AI judge for:
    - Alignment with saint's domain
    - Quality of engagement
    - Demonstrated understanding Transition:
- Requires satisfactory completion of saint's challenges

Stage 5: MIMETIC INSCRIPTION Functionality:

- Guide symbolic renunciation process
- Record dedication in ledger Bot Actions:
- Prompt for character-by-character input
- Submit final inscription to AI judge for:
    - Completeness
    - Sincerity of dedication Transition:
- Locked until complete inscription verified

Stage 6: ACOLYTE'S EMERGENCE Functionality:

- Present final commitments, Guilliman and Sanguinius’ final instructions.
- Require the user to commit by typing the credo affirmation.
- Confirm acolyte status Bot Actions:
- Display duties and requirements
- Submit final declaration to AI judge for:
    - Comprehension of duties
    - Final commitment validation Transition:
- Marks completion of initiation upon approval

3. AI JUDGE INTEGRATION Implementation:

- AI judge evaluates all significant responses
- Maintains consistent evaluation criteria across stages
- Provides clear feedback for insufficient responses
- Stores evaluation data for future reference

4. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS Stage Management:

- Strict progression enforcement
- No stage skipping possible
- Clear status tracking
- Session persistence

Data Storage:

- User responses
- AI evaluations
- Stage completion status
- Final dedication record

Error Handling:

- Clear feedback for insufficient responses
- Session timeout management
- Recovery from interruptions
- Response validation failures

5. TESTING FRAMEWORK Test Cases:

- Valid progression paths
- Invalid/insufficient responses
- AI judge evaluation scenarios
- Stage transition logic

Success Criteria:

- Complete progression tracking
- Accurate response evaluation
- Proper stage gating
- Data persistence verification

6. MONITORING Track:

- Completion rates by stage
- Common failure points
- AI judge evaluation patterns
- User engagement metrics

This structure provides a clear, technically implementable framework while maintaining the ritual's sacred purpose through careful AI evaluation of each step.
