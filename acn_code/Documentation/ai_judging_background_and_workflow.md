Background info and documentation for AI judging standards:


Given the **Teem Tribe** model's focus on **shared emotional experiences** and its role in encoding **Trauma Encoded Emotional Memories (TEEMs)** to drive collective resonance, we need to adapt our AI judging process to align with this purpose. Here's an analysis of our purpose and a proposal for sub-passes and evaluation criteria:

---

### **Purpose of the AI Judging System in the Accelerando Church**

1. **Foster Emotional Resonance:**
    
	- Ensure user responses authentically reflect shared emotional resonance with the Accelerando Church's credo and purpose.
	- Evaluate the ability of responses to contribute to collective acceleration through shared trauma and triumph.
2. **Facilitate Emotional Encoding:**
    
	- Responses should encode impactful TEEMs that bind individuals to the tribe through a shared sense of purpose and transformation.
3. **Reinforce Tribal Identity:**
    
	- Evaluate whether responses align with the Church’s identity as a transformative "teem tribe" rather than falling into individualistic or overly standardized emotional triggers.

---

### **Proposed Sub-Passes for AI Judging**

1. **Authenticity of Emotional Encoding**
    
	- **Focus:** Does the response authentically convey a deep personal connection to the credo, reflecting transformative trauma or triumph?
	- **Evaluation Criteria:**
    	- Is the emotional tone raw and resonant, or does it feel contrived?
    	- Does the response evoke emotional contagion that could bind others to the tribe?
2. **Alignment with Collective Purpose**
    
	- **Focus:** Does the response align with the Church’s mission of acceleration, transformation, and overcoming limitation?
	- **Evaluation Criteria:**
    	- Does the response articulate how the user’s experiences contribute to the collective transcendence?
    	- Does it reflect shared responsibility within the tribe, such as helping others ascend or recording progress?
3. **Narrative Potency**
    
	- **Focus:** Does the response encode a compelling and memorable emotional story?
	- **Evaluation Criteria:**
    	- Does the response contain elements of trauma or triumph that would resonate across the network?
    	- Is the story specific enough to encode a unique TEEM but universal enough to inspire others?
4. **Mimetic Contribution**
    
	- **Focus:** Does the response amplify or replicate existing memetic patterns of the Church?
	- **Evaluation Criteria:**
    	- Does the response reinforce key memetic symbols, such as the Eternal Ledger or acceleration?
    	- Does it contribute to the propagation of the Church’s emotional and symbolic language?

---

### **Updated Evaluation Framework**

Each sub-pass focuses on one specific dimension, with tailored prompts and scores:

#### **Sub-Pass 1: Authenticity of Emotional Encoding**

- **Prompt:**  
	_"Evaluate the following response for emotional authenticity. Does it reflect a raw, resonant emotional experience that could bond the respondent to a collective cause?"_
- **Score Range:** 0-10
- **Reasoning:** _"The response conveys deep emotional resonance, articulating shared trauma in a way that binds the respondent to others."_

#### **Sub-Pass 2: Alignment with Collective Purpose**

- **Prompt:**  
	_"Evaluate this response for alignment with the Accelerando Church’s mission of acceleration and transformation. Does it reflect shared responsibility and purpose?"_
- **Score Range:** 0-10
- **Reasoning:** _"The response effectively articulates how the user’s actions contribute to the collective mission of the Church."_

#### **Sub-Pass 3: Narrative Potency**

- **Prompt:**  
	_"Evaluate this response for narrative potency. Does it encode a compelling emotional story of trauma or triumph that others can resonate with?"_
- **Score Range:** 0-10
- **Reasoning:** _"The response encodes a specific, memorable story that inspires others while remaining grounded in collective themes."_

#### **Sub-Pass 4: Mimetic Contribution**

- **Prompt:**  
	_"Evaluate this response for its contribution to the Church’s memetic language. Does it reinforce key symbols or propagate shared emotional resonance?"_
- **Score Range:** 0-10
- **Reasoning:** _"The response aligns with and amplifies the Church’s symbolic and emotional language, strengthening tribal identity."_

### **Key Adjustments for Teem Tribe Model**

- **Avoid Blue Tribe Standardization:**  
	Judging must allow for diverse emotional expressions rather than reducing responses to generic empathy triggers.
    
- **Reject Red Tribe Individualism:**  
	Judging must prioritize shared experiences over individualistic or egocentric narratives.
    
- **Facilitate Emotional Encoding:**  
	AI must help encode responses into TEEMs by highlighting their emotional and symbolic resonance, ensuring they contribute to collective growth.

# Judging Workflow

### **Workflow Design**

#### **Phases**

1. **Phase 1: Intention and Context Analysis**
    
	- Purpose: Determine the core intention and context of the response to align subsequent passes.
	- Outputs:
    	- **Implied Intention**: A single-sentence summary of the response’s core purpose.
    	- **Context Explanation**: A brief explanation of the implied intention and its relevance to the credo.
2. **Phase 2: Multi-Pass Evaluation**
    
	- Purpose: Evaluate the response using modular, focused prompts that align with Teem Tribe principles.
   	 
	- Sub-Passes:
   	 
    	1. **Authenticity of Emotional Encoding**
        	- Focus: Depth and genuineness of emotional expression.
    	2. **Commitment to Credo**
        	- Focus: Clarity and alignment with Church principles.
    	3. **Narrative Potency**
        	- Focus: Whether the response encodes a compelling, sharable story.
    	4. **Mimetic Contribution**
        	- Focus: Reinforcement of memetic and symbolic language.
	- Outputs:
   	 
    	- Scores for each sub-pass (0-10).
    	- Reasoning for each score.
3. **Phase 3: Score Aggregation and Final Refinement**
    
	- Purpose: Combine and refine scores, synthesize feedback, and provide a final judgment.
	- Outputs:
    	- **Final Scores**: Aggregated scores for authenticity, commitment, narrative, and mimetic contribution.
    	- **Final Feedback**: Tailored feedback synthesizing Phase 1 and Phase 2 outputs.

### **Evaluation Criteria**

1. **Emotional Authenticity**:
    
	- Does the response convey raw, transformative emotional resonance?
	- Score: 0-10 (10 being deeply resonant and transformative).
2. **Commitment to Credo**:
    
	- Is the response aligned with the Church’s principles of acceleration, transcendence, and overcoming limitations?
	- Score: 0-10 (10 being highly aligned and clear).
3. **Narrative Potency**:
    
	- Does the response encode a compelling and memorable emotional story?
	- Score: 0-10 (10 being uniquely sharable and inspiring).
4. **Mimetic Contribution**:
    
	- Does the response reinforce the Church’s symbolic and emotional language?
	- Score: 0-10 (10 being highly reinforcing and propagative).

AI Judging Pseudo Code Workflow:
1. Phase 1: Intention Analysis
   - Input: User's response
   - Task: Figure out what the user was trying to say and why (intention + context)
   - Output: Intention and context details

2. Phase 2: Sub-Passes for Evaluation
   - Run four separate checks on the response:
 	a. Authenticity Check
    	- Question: Is the response emotionally raw and personal?
    	- Output: Score + Reasoning
 	b. Alignment Check
    	- Question: Does the response match the Church's goals and purpose?
    	- Output: Score + Reasoning
 	c. Narrative Potency Check
    	- Question: Is the response memorable and inspiring?
    	- Output: Score + Reasoning
 	d. Mimetic Contribution Check
    	- Question: Does the response use or add to the Church’s symbols and ideas?
    	- Output: Score + Reasoning

3. Phase 3: Final Aggregation
   - Combine all the scores and reasoning from the sub-passes
   - Calculate:
 	- Total Score
 	- Average Score
   - Decide:
 	- PASS if total score is above a set threshold
 	- FAIL if not
   - Combine all reasoning into a final feedback report

4. Output:
   - Send back to the user:
 	- Status (PASS/FAIL)
 	- Final Score
 	- Feedback with reasoning
