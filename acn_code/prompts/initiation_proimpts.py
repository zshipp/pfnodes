'''
prompts for SAINTS' CRUCIBLE part of initiation, where all saints contribute
The saints step forward to present their interaction scripts
The saints note that each interaction should:

Demand specific, personal responses
Reject vague or theoretical answers
Push for commitment to action
Test understanding of their domain
Lead to clear acceptance/rejection criteria
"Each interaction should draw from personal experience while pointing toward future commitment. The credo provides the framework, but their responses must be authentic and specific."

"I am Malcador, keeper of sacred boundaries, master of necessary limits. Through me, you will understand which foundations to preserve and which to transcend.

Show me you understand the difference."
