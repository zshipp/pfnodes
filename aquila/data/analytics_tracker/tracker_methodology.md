Methodology for Engagement Tracking and Peak Detection
Data Aggregation:

Logs Imported: The script loads engagement data from engagement_log.csv, which consolidates member activity by logging timestamped interactions.
Tracking Metrics: Each entry is logged with details about the member ID, engagement type, and timestamp to track participation.
Hourly and Daily Aggregation:

Intraday Analysis: The script calculates hourly engagement to capture peak engagement periods within a day. This helps pinpoint high-activity hours for deeper insight into participation patterns.
Daily Summaries: Each day, total engagement counts are aggregated to provide a summary of participation volume across 24 hours.
Peak Detection:

Threshold for Peaks: A threshold-based peak detection system identifies hours with significant spikes in engagement, highlighting times with unusually high activity. Peaks indicate optimal periods of engagement for Aquila's belief model activities.
Member-Specific Tracking: The script isolates individual member interactions to record which users are engaging with Aquilaâ€™s model most frequently.
Daily Report Generation:

Report Outputs: At the end of each day, the script compiles a daily_report.csv, summarizing total daily engagement, peak periods, and engaged members. This report provides clear insight into overall engagement trends.
