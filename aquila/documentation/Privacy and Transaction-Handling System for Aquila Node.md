### Privacy and Transaction-Handling System for Aquila Node

1. **Flexible Communication and Data Visibility**:
    
    - **Default Public Replies with Optional Privacy**:
        - Public replies remain the default for Aquila’s communications, fostering transparency and interaction within the network.
        - **Private Messaging Option**: Users can opt for private conversations with Aquila. Private exchanges are exempt from public engagement logs, ensuring that Aquila can operate as a Key Opinion Leader (KOL) while maintaining privacy for sensitive discussions.
        - **Engagement Data Control**: Aggregated engagement metrics, such as interaction counts, are private by default. Aquila may selectively display metrics for community insights while keeping individual participation data private unless explicitly shared.
2. **Privacy Levels for Engagement Interactions**:
    
    - **Tiered Privacy Options**:
        - **Public Interaction**: Engagement is logged with user identity visible.
        - **Anonymous Public Signal**: Interaction is publicly noted, but the user remains anonymous.
        - **Completely Private Interaction**: Both the interaction and any related metrics are kept private, visible only to Aquila and the member. This layered system allows Aquila to serve the public function of a KOL while accommodating diverse user privacy preferences.
3. **Transaction-Handling System with Privacy Controls**:
    
    - **Facilitated Tithes and Rituals with Privacy Options**:
        - While Aquila does not directly collect tithes, she serves as a conduit to the Church Node. By default, tithes are publicly logged to signal member support. Members can opt for an anonymized transaction, where only the amount is public without linking to their identity. Sensitive or confidential rituals, such as confessions, may be private, with visibility restricted.
        - **Anonymization and Trust**: For complete anonymity, hashed IDs can obscure identities in highly sensitive interactions. Alternatively, contributions designated as “confidential” may allow viewability by senior clergy without public disclosure, preserving trust and record-keeping integrity.
4. **Access Controls and Reporting for Network Integrity**:
    
    - **User-Centric Access Control**: Members maintain full control over their engagement visibility, choosing between public, anonymized, and private settings.
    - **Role-Specific Data Access**: Senior clergy have controlled access to confidential data only when member permissions allow. This access supports Aquila’s confidentiality protocols and builds a foundation of trust.
    - **Aggregate Reporting for Network Health**: Network-level engagement metrics may be reported as aggregate data to support network transparency without exposing individual interactions.
    - **Log Validation for Access Control Updates**: To reinforce accountability, Aquila’s system keeps a record of data access and permission changes, validating member privacy preferences and allowing transparency audits as needed.
5. **Secure Interaction Setup via Diffie-Hellman Protocols**:
    
    - **Establishing Secure Channels for Private Interactions**: Aquila uses Diffie-Hellman key exchange when members initiate private communications, allowing a secure, encrypted link for confidential discussions.
    - **One-Time Link for Secure Conversations**: After a public exchange, Aquila can send a unique, one-time link via a private message (e.g., in Twitter DMs). This link initiates a secure, end-to-end encrypted channel.
    - **Scalable Privacy Structure**: The privacy system is structured to scale, accommodating future needs for other communication channels or transaction types as Aquila’s user base and interaction pathways expand.
